# Machine Learning
# 1.KNN
KNN method is mainly for classification. Given a training dataset with labels, KNN will help to predict the classification of the new data by calculating the distance with each pieces of the existing data and finding its k nearest neighbors. The majority is the new class we assign to the new data.
# 2. Decision Tree
Decision tree uses a tree-like model to describe the classification of the instances. A decision tree is drawn upside down with its root at the top. The decision blocks(rectangles) represents a condition/internal node, based on which the tree splits into branches/ edges. The end of the branch that doesnâ€™t split anymore is the leaf, which represent various classes.  One of the best things about decision trees is that we can easily understand the data.
